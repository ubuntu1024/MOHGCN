# MOHGCN
MOHGCN: A Trustworthy Multi-omics Data Integration Framework Based on Specificity-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks for Disease Diagnosis.
This repository contains the code of our paper MOHGCN: A Trustworthy Multi-omics Data Integration Framework Based on Specificity-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Networks for Disease Diagnosis. The data used in the paper can be obtained through the following links https://github.com/txWang/MOGONET. The co-expression matrix is constructed using the "WGCNA" package in the R programming language.
